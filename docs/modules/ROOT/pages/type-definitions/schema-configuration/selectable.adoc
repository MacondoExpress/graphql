== `@selectable`

This directive controls if the field will be available on queries and aggregations. 

It has two arguments:

* **onRead****: If disabled, this field will not be available on queries and subscriptions.
* **onAggregation**: If disabled, aggregations will not be available for this field


=== Definition

[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
"""Instructs @neo4j/graphql to generate this field for selectable fields."""
directive @selectable(onRead: Boolean! = true, onAggregate: Boolean! = true) on FIELD_DEFINITION
----

=== Usage

With the following definition:

[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
type Movie {
    title: String!
    description: String @selectable(onRead: false, onAggregate: true)
}
----

The type `Movie` in the resulting schema will look:

[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
type Movie {
    title: String!
}
----

This means that descriptions cannot be queries, neither on top or on nested levels. Aggregations, however, are available for both:
[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
type MovieAggregateSelection {
    count: Int!
    description: StringAggregateSelectionNullable!
    title: StringAggregateSelectionNonNullable!
}
----
